This is where I keep all of my dotfiles for macOS.

Many of my dotfiles were gleaned from other sources, so feel free to copy any of the dotfiles or scripts you find here.

I plan on eventually adding an install script to make it easier for others to use, but for now, you'll have to cobble things together yourself.
